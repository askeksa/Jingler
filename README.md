# Jingler
[Jingler](https://github.com/askeksa/Jingler) is (going to be) a flexible,
modular synthesizer with a primary focus on making music for small
[demoscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene) productions - similar in
spirit to popular modular demoscene synthesizers such as
[4klang](https://github.com/hzdgopher/4klang) and
[64klang](https://github.com/hzdgopher/64klang).

It is a goal of Jingler to be more versatile and easier to use than 4klang
while achieving similar or even smaller file sizes.

## State of development
Jingler is still early in its development. Some ideas for its features and
design can be read in the [design document](DESIGN.md).
